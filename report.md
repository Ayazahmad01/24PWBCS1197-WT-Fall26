# Lab 01 Report
In this lab I learned how to create and manage files using Git and GitHub in a practical way.
I practiced uploading my work by adding, committing, and pushing files to a remote repository.
I also explored how to create separate branches and later merge them back into the main branch.
Working with branches showed me how developers can test changes safely without disturbing the main project.
Overall, this lab helped me better understand version control and the basic workflow of Git in real-world use.
